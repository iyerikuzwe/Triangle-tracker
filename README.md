# Project description.
    This is an application that determines whether a set of three numbers can either make a scalene,Equilateral and or Isosceles triangle.
## Requirements
    1.  A running network connection to the internet.
    2.  A web browser.

### BDD

    1. if the sum of two sides is equal or exceeds the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle. --input - hypotenuse (7), opposite (2), adjacent (19) --output - values show an indefinite triangle.

    2. if the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that an Equilateral triangle. --input - first value (10),
     second value (10), third value (10) --output - Triangle is Equilateral.
    3. if two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle. --input - first value (9), second value (9), third value(6) --output - Triangle is Iscoceles. 
    4. if the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle. --input - first value (7), second value (5), third value (8) --output- Triangle is Scalene.
